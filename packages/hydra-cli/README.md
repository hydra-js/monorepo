# Hydra-JS CLI

## Development

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14 or later)
- npm (v7 or later)

### Setup

```bash
git clone git@github.com:hydra-js/monorepo.git hydra-js-monorepo
cd hydra-js-monorepo/packages/hydra-cli
npm install
```

### Running locally

To run the CLI tool locally without installing it globally, use:

```bash
node index.js init [appName]
```

### Running locally with `npm link`

> This section provides instructions on how to use `npm link` for local development, enabling you to test the CLI tool as if it were installed globally.


To link the CLI tool locally for development and testing, use `npm link`:

1. Run `npm link` in the project directory. This creates a symlink globally:

```bash
npm link
```

2. Now you can run the `hydra` command from anywhere on your system:

```bash
hydra init [appName]
```

This allows you to test changes to the CLI tool without needing to reinstall it each time you make modifications.

### Publishing

To publish the package to npm:

1. Ensure you are logged in to npm:

```bash
npm login
```

2. Make sure the NPM_TOKEN secret is added to your GitHub repository.

3. Create a new version tag and push it to GitHub:

```bash
git tag v1.0.0
git push origin v1.0.0
```

The GitHub Actions workflow will automatically publish the package to npm when a new tag is pushed.
